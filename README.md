# README
non-extreme game

If you want to edit the contents, I recommend you edit deceptionsnapshot.sb3 on Scratch or Turbowarp. Or, you can be an expert and edit everything from here (which I do not recommend as the game may crash).

To play, unzip this file and click deception.exe. To unzip, you can unzip this by 7-Zip, or use the built-in unzip from Windows.

Snapshot W12M1 (1.0.1 Alpha)
